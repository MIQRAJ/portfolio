        <textarea rows="12" cols="60">
    About a year ago, i knew nothing about coding although i have friends around me who code.
    The passion to code came after i graduated from ALX virtual assistant programme early this year.
    I happen to join a community after graduation where i met young programmers who build great stuff from scratch.
    I said to myself that if younger individuals could do this why can't I. Then i enrolled into a javascript class
    with Udacity although i couldn't proceed because it was all like magic. Then i got to know about stutern.
    I should say that this great journey started with stutern.</textarea
